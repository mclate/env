My small environment stuff. Definately useful for me and might be usefull for someone.

Usage
===

# Clone repository into ~/.bin folder: git clone https://github.com/mclate/env ~/.bin
# Add this line into your ~/.bassrc file: [ -f ~/.bin/.bashrc ] && source ~/.bin.bashrc
# Relogin

Additionally you can create ~/.bin.hostinfo file which is specific to this host (you can add color definitions there or some specific aliases etc)
